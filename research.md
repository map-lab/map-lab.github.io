We study the cell biology of __G protein-coupled receptors__, focusing on receptors that are relevant to drug addiction.

Our research addresses an exciting new aspect of GPCR function - spatial encoding of signaling. This concept suggests that signaling is specified not just by which drugs activate which receptors, but also by where in the cell the receptors are signaling from. That is, the same receptors, signaling from different sites (e.g., cell surface vs. intracellular compartments) can induce different responses at a physiological level.

We are developing innovative imaging and molecular genetic techniques to directly visualize receptor location and function in real time in living cells. The goal is to find the mechanisms that traffic receptors between cellular membranes, and the signaling pathways that regulate this trafficking. The long-term goal is to actively engineer receptor localization to specific regions and fine-tune the spatial encoding of signaling by any drug, hormone, or neurotransmitter. This is a new and potentially transformative approach to receptor pharmacology and drug development.
